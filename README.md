In "CS364A: Algorithmic Game Theory," Tim Roughgarden states that any bimatrix, zero-sum game has a Nash Equilibrium that can be found within polynomial time. I do not have the skills to prove it, but I did implement it. I also implemented solving any bimatrix (not necessarily zero-sum) but obviously did not run it with the time constraint in mind.

I also made a website for it. This is not new --

GTE (Game Theory Explorer) is also a website that accomplishes this but it requires Adobe Flash Player (which is dead -- thus rendering the website dead).

Gambit (C library) accomplishes this and more -- but I more so wanted to focus on the website implementation and the time constraint.

tldr; I made a working website focused on finding the Nash Equilibrium for bimatrix, zero-sum games within polynomial time.
