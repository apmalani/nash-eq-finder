# nash-eq-finder
In "CS364A: Algorithmic Game Theory," Tim Roughgarden states that any bimatrix, zero-sum game as a Nash Equilibrium that can be found within polynomial time. I do not have the skills to prove it, but I did implement it.

I also made a website for it. This is not new --

GTE (Game Theory Explorer) is also a website that accomplishes this but it requires Adobe Flash Player (which is dead).

Nashpy (Python library) accomplishes this and more -- but I more so wanted to focus on the website implementation and the time constraint.
